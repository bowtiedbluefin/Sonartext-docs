## Upload Methods

### R2 Multipart Uploads (Recommended)
For files larger than 100MB, use our R2 multipart upload system:

1. **Initiate**: Start a multipart upload with `/v1/uploads/initiate`
2. **Upload**: Send file parts directly to Cloudflare R2 using presigned URLs
3. **Complete**: Finish the upload and start transcription with `/v1/uploads/complete`

### Legacy Direct Uploads
For existing clients and smaller files:
- Traditional multipart/form-data upload
- Supports files up to 2GB
- Direct to `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint
